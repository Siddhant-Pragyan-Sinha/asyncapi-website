> *Somehow, we're here. And we saved you a spot at OpenNest Africa!*

In the last quarter, something beautiful came to life.

During the [She Code Africa - Admin](https://medium.com/u/ca5206c12562?source=post_page---user_mention--a2e1fda4f0c0---------------------------------------) HerToberfest × Made in Nigeria Hackathon, my team and I built a project from the depths of our stories, frustrations, and hopes. We called it **OpenNest Africa**, a place where anyone can learn how to contribute to open-source projects, regardless of their tech background.

<br />

**And guess what?**

<br />

We won **first place** at the Hackathon. And while that moment meant so much to us, it meant even more to the people we built this for — those who've ever felt open source wasn't meant for people like them.

> *Our mission is to empower beginners to confidently navigate the world of open source by providing essential resources, guidance, and a supportive community.*

## Why OpenNest Africa exists

<Figure

OpenNest Africa is more than a platform.

**It's a home!**

It's a home for developers, writers, designers, community managers, and even the curious explorer unsure of where to begin.

It's your go-to resource to understand open source — without the jargon, the overwhelm, or the pressure to be a "tech expert." Because here's the truth: open source should be for everyone.

## The Stories That Sparked OpenNest Africa

OpenNest Africa was born from our lived experiences - from the moments when we felt lost, unsure, curious, and hopeful. Every single member of our team brought something personal to this project.

And while I'm sharing *my* story here, it's one of many that shaped OpenNest Africa. This platform is deeply rooted in all of us.

In 2021, I was completely new to tech.

I didn't have a computer science degree or any traditional tech background. I was figuring things out as I went, trying to find my place in a world that often felt intimidating. (Read more about [here](https://medium.com/@muibudeenaishat/my-tech-journey-as-a-ui-ux-designer-fb8a2b3dea70).)

My sister used to tell me about open source. She kept saying how powerful it was and how it could open doors. But honestly, I didn't get it. It felt like something for people who were already "in"-people who could code and knew what they were doing, not for me.

Then, one day, I came across a tweet from the AsyncAPI Initiative community. They were looking for technical writers. I wasn't a writer. However, I had acquired some design skills, and something in me just… leaned in. I applied.

And that changed everything.

During the interview, I shared where I was coming from, my background, my doubts, and the fact that I didn't know what I was doing. But instead of being shut out, they welcomed me in. They connected me to the design lead, and for the first time, I felt like there might be a place for me in the open-source community.

It wasn't easy, though.

GitHub looked like a sea of code. I didn't understand how anything worked. I would ask questions on Slack, forget what people told me, and then ask the same questions again. And you know what? People still helped me.

*I didn't become confident overnight.*

I kept showing up, confused, curious, and determined. I started paying attention to how others did things, asked more questions (even when it felt silly), and celebrated the tiniest wins, like figuring out how to comment on an issue and finally understanding what a pull request does.

And little by little… things started to click.

I found people who didn't just tolerate beginners; they embraced them. I found a space that allowed me to grow at my own pace and stopped feeling like an outsider somewhere along the way. Eventually, I started helping others, people who were just as unsure as I once was. I would explain things in the way I **wished** someone had described them to me. And from there, my confidence grew, too.

Today, I am the **Design Lead at AsyncAPI**. The same community that once welcomed me is now a space I help lead. I mentor new designers, help make decisions, and shape how we welcome others. **I also serve on the Code of Conduct Committee and the Technical Steering Committee**, which once seemed so far away from someone like me.

Sometimes, I look back at the girl, scared to open her first pull request, and want to hug her. She had no idea she'd get here. I had no idea she was already enough.

You see that journey - messy, slow - is why **OpenNest Africa** exists. We have been there and want to ensure that no one else feels like they don't belong here.

## The Founders of OpenNest Africa

We are four women, builders, dreamers, and believers in what's possible. We each brought something different: design, writing, coding, community, and compassion. Together, we're building more than a platform.

We're building a movement to make open source in Africa inclusive, human, and beautiful.

## Where We're Headed?

<br />

Winning the Hackathon was just the beginning.

<br />

Now, we're dreaming bigger:

- We want to create beginner-friendly guides, videos, and resources.
- Grow our contributors — one person, one story at a time.
- Collaborate with amazing open-source communities that are doing powerful work.

<br />

If this mission speaks to you, we invite you to join us:

- Star our project on [GitHub](https://github.com/open-nest-africa)
- Join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/opennestafrica/shared_invite/zt-34axoub3n-lQTtFlPezkyls8~ncwHfiQ) community
- Tell a friend who's been afraid to try open-source

<br />

Let's build a future where everyone has a seat at the table.

> *You don't have to know how to write code.*
> 
> *You don't have to be perfect.*
>
> *You just have to be willing, and we'll meet you where you are.*
